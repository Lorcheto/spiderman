            <hr width="100%" size="2">Spider-Man's secret identity is
            Peter Parker, a teenage high school student and an orphan
            raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after
            his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash.
            Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of
            adolescence and financial issues and gave him many
            supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah
            Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy,
            Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and his enemies such as
            the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom. In his origin
            story, Spider-Man gets his superhuman spider-powers and
            abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider; these
            include superhuman strength, speed, agility, jump, reflexes,
            stamina, durability, coordination, and balance, clinging to
            surfaces and ceilings like a spider, and detecting danger
            with his precognition ability called "spider-sense". He also
            builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot
            artificial spider-webs of his own design that were used for
            fighting his enemies and web-swinging across the city. Peter
            Parker originally used his powers for his own personal gain,
            but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that Peter did
            not stop, Peter began to use his spider-powers to fight
            crime by becoming the superhero known as Spider-Man.<br>
